# Delivery App - Frequently Asked Questions

## Order Tracking

### Q: Why hasn't my delivery status updated?
The delivery status syncs with our system every 15 minutes. If your status hasn't changed:
1. Pull down to refresh the tracking screen
2. Wait at least 30 minutes before reporting an issue
3. During peak hours (10am-2pm, 6pm-9pm), updates may be delayed up to 1 hour
4. If still not updated after 1 hour, contact support

### Q: What do the delivery statuses mean?
- **Order Placed:** We received your order
- **Processing:** Warehouse is preparing your items
- **Dispatched:** Driver has picked up your package
- **Out for Delivery:** Driver is en route to your location
- **Delivered:** Package was dropped off
- **Delivery Attempted:** Driver tried but couldn't complete delivery

### Q: The app shows "Delivered" but I didn't receive my package
1. Check with family members, neighbors, or building security
2. Look for a delivery photo in the app (tap on the order)
3. Check alternative drop-off locations (back door, garage)
4. If still not found, report within 24 hours through the app

## App Issues

### Q: App crashes when I try to upload proof of delivery photo
This usually happens when the photo file is too large:
1. Close other running apps to free up memory
2. In your phone's camera settings, reduce photo resolution
3. Clear the Delivery app cache: Settings → Apps → Delivery → Clear Cache
4. Try again with the camera app in "Standard" mode (not HDR)

### Q: I can't see my past orders
Past orders are visible for 90 days. If recent orders are missing:
1. Check you're logged into the correct account
2. Pull down to refresh the order history
3. Check internet connection
4. Log out and log back in
